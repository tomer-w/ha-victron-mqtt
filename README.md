A Home Assistant integration that connects to Victron Energy devices using MQTT, providing real-time monitoring of your Victron system including inverters, solar chargers, and battery systems.

## Features

- üîå Auto-discovery of Victron devices via SSDP ([Cerbo GX](https://www.victronenergy.com/communication-centres/cerbo-gx), etc)
- üìä Comprehensive sensor data including:
  - Battery metrics (voltage, current, power, temperature, state of charge)
  - Solar/PV metrics (voltage, current, power, yield)
  - Grid metrics (voltage, current, power, energy)
  - Inverter metrics (input/output power, frequency)
  - EV Charger metrics
- üïπÔ∏è Two-way control over your Victron installation:  
   - inverter mode (On, Off, Charger Only, Inverter Only)  
   - EV Charger (On, Off, current limit)  
   - charger current limit
- ‚ö° Real-time updates via MQTT
- üîí Optional SSL and authentication support
- üåê Multi-phase system support
- All current supported entities are auto-documented [here](https://tomer-w.github.io/victron_mqtt/)

## Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)
1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Go to HACS > Integrations
3. Click the "+" button and search for "Victron MQTT"
4. Click "Download"
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/victron-mqtt` folder to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

### Script-Based Update (For Limited Bandwidth Environments)
If you prefer not to use HACS due to bandwidth constraints, especially in marine environments, you can use the provided update script to manually update the integration after it was installed for the first time.

1. Open the HA Terminal window.
2. For the first time only, you need to give the script execution permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /config/custom_components/victron_mqtt/update_integration.sh
   ```
2. Run the script using a terminal:
   ```bash
   /config/custom_components/victron_mqtt/update_integration.sh
   ```
3. Optionally, use the `--restart` flag to restart Home Assistant after the update:
   ```bash
   /config/custom_components/victron_mqtt/update_integration.sh --restart
   ```
   This will validate the Home Assistant configuration and issue a restart command if the configuration is valid.

4. Restart Home Assistant manually if you did not use the `--restart` flag.

This script will fetch the latest version of the integration directly from the repository and replace the existing files.

## Configuration

The integration can be configured in three ways:

### Method 1: Automatic Discovery
1. Your Victron device should be automatically discovered if it has MQTT enabled
2. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
3. Look for the "Victron MQTT Integration" in the discovered section
4. Follow the configuration flow

### Method 2: Manual Configuration (Direct Connection)
1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Victron MQTT Integration"
4. Enter the following details:
   - Host: Your Victron device's hostname or IP (default: venus.local)
   - Port: (See below)
   - Username: (See below)
   - Password: (See below)
   - SSL: (See below)

Your Victron can be configured to use different levels of security. On the Victron Console (or Remote console) go to the Settings / General menu. The option ‚ÄúLocal Network Security Profile‚Äù can have one of three options: ‚ÄúUnsecured‚Äù, ‚ÄúWeak‚Äù or ‚ÄúSecured‚Äù. If it is set to ‚ÄúWeak‚Äù or ‚ÄúSecured‚Äù you will have had to specify a password when setting the option.

Specify values for the Port, Username, Password and SSL options based on the setting of this security profile.

- If the security profile is set to Unsecured‚Äù, use the following values:
   - Port: The unsecure MQTT port number (usually 1883)
   - User name: Leave blank
   - Password: Leave blank
   - SSL: Disabled

- If the security profile is either ‚ÄúWeak‚Äù or ‚ÄúSecured‚Äù, use the following values:
   - Port: The secure MQTT port number (usually 8883)
   - User name: Leave blank
   - Password: The password defined when setting the security profile
   - SSL: Enabled

### Method 3: Using Home Assistant MQTT Broker (Bridged Configuration)
Some users prefer to reduce the direct load on their Victron server and use bridge from the Venus device to a local mosquitto server running as add-on on the HAOS.

#### Prerequisites
1. Install the [Mosquitto broker add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mosquitto) from the Home Assistant Add-on Store
2. Configure a user and password for the MQTT broker in the add-on configuration

#### Configuration Steps
1. **Configure the Mosquitto Bridge**: Edit the Mosquitto configuration file at `/share/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` (accessible via File Editor add-on or SSH) and add:
   ```
   connection victron
   address <YOUR_VENUS_IP>:1883
   topic N/# in 0
   # TO CHANGE settings via MQTT, one has to write to the "W/" topic!!
   topic W/# out 0
   topic R/# out 0
   start_type automatic
   allow_anonymous true
   ```
   Replace `<YOUR_VENUS_IP>` with your Victron device's IP address.

2. **Restart the Mosquitto Add-on** to apply the bridge configuration

3. **Configure the Integration**: When setting up the Victron MQTT Integration:
   - Host: `core-mosquitto` (the internal hostname for the HA MQTT broker)
   - Port: `1883`
   - Username: Your MQTT broker username
   - Password: Your MQTT broker password
   - SSL: Disable (internal connection doesn't require SSL)

#### Benefits of Bridged Configuration
- Reduces load on the Venus MQTT server
- Provides a single MQTT broker for all your Home Assistant MQTT devices
- Allows for better network traffic management

## Adding entities
If you want to help the community and add more entities, please take a look at the [module](https://github.com/tomer-w/victron_mqtt) which drives this integration. It is very simple to extend this integration. I wrote a [document](https://github.com/tomer-w/victron_mqtt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) about it.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot Connect**
   - Verify your Victron device is powered on and connected to your network
   - Check that the hostname/IP is correct.
   - Ensure that MQTT is enabled on your Victron device.
   - On your HA device, open Terminal window using one of the addons and run the following command:
   ```
   nc -zv <Cerbo IP address> <Cerbo mqtt port, usually 8883>
   ```
   if you are getting timeout or other errors there is real connectivity issue and it is not integration issue.
   - in case venus OS is rooted (i.e. with ssh access enabled):
     - use port 8883
     - enable SSL/TLS
     - use user root
     - use password that you have defined to protect the instance
   - **Alternative**: Consider using the bridged configuration (Method 3) if you're experiencing frequent connectivity issues or want to reduce load on your Venus device.

2. **Authentication Failed**
   - Double-check the username and password if authentication is enabled.
   - Note: These are device credentials, not VRM portal credentials.

3. **No Sensors Appear**
   - Verify that MQTT topics are being published by your Victron device.
   - Check the Home Assistant logs for any error messages.
